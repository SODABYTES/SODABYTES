I'm SODABYTES, and I mostly like screwing around in Godot.

# Projects I've created

## Pyramis
A solo-developed game. Currently in active development.

# Projects I've contributed to

## Payment Comes on Friday (by Team Gladiolus)
I mainly put together and programmed the background behind the warehouse. I also made a few tweaks and bug fixes.

## Dragon Drop (by Cloudy Games LLC)
I was commissioned to draw one of the unlockable loading screens.

## Raindrop Sprinters (by Shuhei Miyazawa)
I didn't work on this game directly, but I am in the Special Thanks section of the credits for finding an exploit, messaging the developer about it, and suggesting a fix.
